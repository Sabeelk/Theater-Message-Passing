# Theater-Message-Passing

The program is a reimplementation of the synchronized theater scenario.
All of the synchronized calls between the thread are now done through a client server implementation. 
The client will make a call to the server to run the methods of the threads.

The program is started by runnign StartClients.java in a single terminal.
The MainServer.java is run in another terminal.
They should then pass messages between each other.
